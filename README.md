# Library Management System

## About Project
Library Management System is a fun project that I started in March'23 to learn more about object-oriented programming in C++ and to get some hands-on experience working on a project. 

So far, it's just a simple project with a few functions. However, as the project moves forward, more interesting functions will be added.

### Here are some of the feature

* Library consists of 3 books
* User can issue a certain book among the list
